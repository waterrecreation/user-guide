# Follow

Community is always about connecting. When you encounter someone who resonates with your vibe, make sure to hit that "Follow" button.&#x20;

When you follow someone on Popula, you will send a transaction to [Popula main contract ](https://nearblocks.io/address/app.popula.near)which records your social graph on NEAR Blockchain. The gas cost will be around 0.001 $NEAR, which will be covered by the allowance first.

By doing so, you're not just following their updates, but also weaving the threads of your **on-chain social graph**.&#x20;

This ensures that each member’s social graph is permanently and transparently stored on-chain, making it portable across applications interacting with Popula’s smart contract.

You can follow someone either from their profile page, or their profile card.

## **Following from Profile Page:**&#x20;

Visit the profile page of the user you'd like to follow.&#x20;

Look for the "Follow" button.

Click on it to start following and stay updated with their posts and activities.

## **Following from Profile Card:**&#x20;

For an even quicker follow action, hover over the profile photo of the user you wish to follow.&#x20;

As you do, a profile card will elegantly pop up, displaying essential information.&#x20;

Right there on the card, you'll find the "Follow" button—click it to instantly start following the user.
