# Echo

**Echo** is for sharing other content in your posts; with a verifiable stamp signifying the source of content.

Currently, you can echo a Popula **Post**, an **NFT,** or a **Tweet**, bringing extra attention and engagement to your post and therefore receiving more drips.

The echoed content will activate [Drip Royalties](../drips-and-drip-royalties/drip-royalties.md): sharing Drips with the original content creator or owner of the NFT and providing them with additional Drips.

ðŸ‘‰ For additional details on how Drip Royalties work, please refer to [Drip Royalties](../drips-and-drip-royalties/drip-royalties.md).



#### Echo a Post on Popula

1. Go to the post and find the "Echo" button below it.
2. Click on the button and choose "Echo"
3. Select the community you want to repost the post to, and click on "Post"
4. Add your comments and then post it.

#### Echo an NFT

Besides native posts on Popula, you can also echo an NFT outside Popula (on either Ethereum or NEAR) to your post. The NFT owner will then receive a 5% share of the passive Drips from this post. Share and curate your favorite NFTs to the community! âœ¨

1. Enter a community and find the post text box.
2. Click on the 'Insert' button (the second button from the left under the post box).
3. Choose NFT.
4. Select the chain (ETH Mainnet or NEAR Mainnet) and enter the wallet address.
5. The NFTs owned by that account will be displayed below. Select an NFT to insert into the post.

#### Echo a Tweet

You can also add a tweet from Twitter to your post.

1. Go to a community and find the post text box.
2. Click on the 'Insert' button (the second button from the left under the post box).
3. Select Twitter.
4. Enter the link to the tweet.
5. The Tweet will be loaded and you can then add it to your post.

With the Echo function on Popula, creators can directly benefit from a share of their content, while curators can contribute more meaningfully to the growth of creators. The **Echo** function is the cog in the wheel of **Drip Royalties.** Through Echo, Drip Royalties will organically accumulate momentum and kickstart the flywheel of multiplayer creation.

Of course, you can also choose to prevent others from **echoing** your post on Popula.

1. Look for a Drip icon with a percentage sign located near the token-gating button.
2. Click on it to open the Drip Royalty \*\*\*\*pop-up window.
3. Select whether reposting is enabled or not by clicking on the checkbox. If enabled, you can adjust the percentage as needed.
4. Confirm the change.
