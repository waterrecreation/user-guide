# Post

On the top of the community homepage, you can easily find the **Content Editor**, the tool for publishing contents on chain, including token-gated contents, echos, polls, and proposals. With Content Editor, content creation and curation is a breeze.

## C**reate a post**

To create a post, simply write something down in the post, and click on "Post". Now you can post up to 1000 characters, and you also enrich your content using emojis or inserting images, or [echo](../echo.md)ing someone elseâ€™s content from within Popula or elsewhere.&#x20;

**Content Editor** is also the entry to start a [poll](../poll-and-proposal.md#how-to-create-a-poll) or [proposal](../poll-and-proposal.md#how-to-create-a-proposal) to gather opinions or make collective decisions.&#x20;

### Drip-gated Post

You can also post **Drips-gated posts** in communities by clicking the â€˜lockâ€™ button beside the Post button. A drip-gated post requires other members to **hold or burn** a minimum amount of Drips to view its content, including its comments.

Here's how to set a post as token-gated.

1. Set a sneak peek for the gated content to get people interested or leave them a hint. The sneak peek is public to all.
2. Choose how to unlock the post, whether it's **hold Drips to unlock**, or **burn Drips to unlock**.
3. Set the amount of the tokens required to hold or burn, and then click on confirm.

Others can only access the content as well as the comment under this post if they meet the requirements to unlock the post.&#x20;

> _ðŸ’§ Please note that each community has its own Drips. Drips here means drips generated in this community._

### **Set Post Drip Royalties**

When creating a post on Popula, you have the option to set a **personalised percentage** of Drip Royalties for that post. These Drip Royalties will be applied whenever the post is [**echoed**](../echo.md) in a new post. This means that you will receive a share of the passive Drips generated by othersâ€™ echoed posts. The default Drip Royalty will be 5%.

You can also choose to disable Echo for your post and others will not be able to echo your post.
