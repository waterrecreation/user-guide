# Report & Delete

### Report

If you come across any post or comment that breaks the community rules, you can report it.

Populaâ€™s Reporting uses the **Drip-based Report Mechanism**, which not only motivates users to maintain a healthy community atmosphere but also prevents report spamming.

The reporter needs to **stake 1 Drip** for each report.

Community moderators can decide whether the report is approved, ignored, or disapproved, and the reporter will get recognition, redeem their stake, or lose the stake respectively.

You can also simply block the post as well if you donâ€™t want to see it.

All the activities are recorded on chain, and you can look it up by choosing the TX option within the dropdown list of the three dots symbol.

### Delete

If the post or comment is posted by yourself, you will see the option to delete it.

ðŸ’¡ **What happens to deleted content?**

All deleted content, be it having been deleted by yourself or removed via report is hidden from the community feed and thus no longer visible.

However, since the content is still stored on-chain, it will always exist there. The owner can always access it in transactions or port it to somewhere else if they wish.

This is also to maintain a reasonable balance between content moderation and freedom of expression.
