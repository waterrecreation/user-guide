# Poll & Proposal

#### How to create a Poll?

1. Go to a community where you want to start the Poll.
2. Find the section to create a post, and enter the poll question in the post box.
3. Then click the button ‘Poll’ below the post box.
4. Add up to 4 options. Then, determine the duration of the Poll and Confirm.
5. Review the details for the Poll, and click on ‘Post’ to publish it. You can also set Drips Royalties for this Poll or set this Poll as Drip-gated.

The Poll will automatically be closed and the results will be tallied after the time ends.

#### How to create a Proposal?

1. Navigate to the Community, and make sure that you have permission to create a proposal. (This depends on the permission settings in the Community Console.)
2. Find the section to create a post, and enter the proposal in the post box.
3. Click "create a proposal" button below the post box.
4. Set parameters for your Proposal.
   * **Start time:** start proposal voting from the time of posting, or set a time for proposal voting to start. The proposal will be activated immediately or at the scheduled time.
   * **End time:** add a duration for the proposal or specify an end time for the proposal
   * **Who can vote:** Choose who can participate in the voting process. You can select all members or only members who have a certain amount of total Drips. If you opt for the latter, you need to define the Drip threshold required to vote.
   * **Minimum Participation:** Specify the minimum number of participants required for the voting process to be considered valid. This ensures that proposals are not passed with a low level of participation. You can directly enter the percentage in the text box or use the slider below to adjust it.
   * **Support Threshold:** Set the minimum percentage of votes in favor of a proposal required for it to be passed. This ensures that proposals are not approved with insufficient support. You can directly enter the percentage in the text box or use the slider below to adjust it.
5. Click on Next on the top right to proceed to the next page.
   * **Voting Method:** Select the preferred voting method for the proposal. Popula currently supports two types of voting methods:
     * Account-based: Each account is entitled to one vote.
     * Drip-based: The number of votes is determined by the amount of Drips.
   *   **Voting Options:** Provide the voting options and the corresponding actions that community members can choose from.

       * Yes or no. Voters can choose either yes or no on a proposed action. This allows users to vote on a proposed action. The designated action will be implemented **automatically** If the proposal is approved.
       * Customise the options. You can set multiple options for users to choose from: each corresponding to a specific action.

       We currently have three actions, each of which requires different parameters to be set.

       *   Token transfer

           * Transfer to all community members.
           * Transfer to group members.
           * Transfer to a selected account, and input the recipient’s NEAR wallet address.

           Then choose the type and amount of tokens. If you choose to transfer to community or group members, you’ll need to determine the distribution method, whether it is equally distributed or based on the proportion of Drips.

           Please note that you can only choose from the existing tokens in the Community Treasury, and the amount cannot exceed the existing amount in the Community Treasury.
       *   Group Management

           * Add a member to the MOD group.
           * Remove a member from the MOD group.

           Remember to input the target NEAR wallet address below.
       *   No action

           If you choose "no action," the proposal will not execute any operation after approval. This is to ensure that other types of proposals or proposals that can only be executed outside Popula can also be publicly voted on in Popula with full transparency and on chain records.
6. Confirm all the settings for this proposal before posting.

#### How to cast a vote?

1. Find the proposal or poll that you want to vote on.
2. Review the details and options presented in the proposal or poll. Make sure you are eligible to cast a vote.
3.  Click on the option that you want to vote for.

    > If it's a Drip-based proposal, enter the amount of Drips you want to stake for your vote.

Once you have voted, the current voting numbers will be displayed, and you will not be able to modify your vote. Your vote will be recorded on chain and will count towards the final outcome of the proposal or poll.
