#### Coming for the content, staying for the community

Sharing high-signal content in a low-noise environment is what we are all about. Out with relying on central authority and in with community originators establishing neutral territory; with the security and stability of smart contracts on the Near blockchain. This ensures fairness and transparency.

In addition to community management, the platform also includes features such as community-specific feed and the Drip protocol, which can be used to prove participation and measure valuable contributions. Drips, non-transferable fungible tokens, can also be used for accessing gated content, allowing community members to have an immediate and tangible utility within their favourite communities.
