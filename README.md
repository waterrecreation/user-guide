What sets Popula apart is its pioneering move to a fully on-chain architecture, elevating members' contributions to new heights of credibility and permanence.&#x20;

Recognizing these valuable contributions, members receive reputation points, referred to as "Drips," and are granted a stake in the co-ownership of the platform.

## Our Mission

Populaâ€™s mission is to create a web3 platform empowering ownership and enriching socio-economic engagement. Popula ensures that membersâ€™ contributions are provable and everlasting by recording them on-chain and measuring them with non-transferrable fungible tokens and platform co-ownership.
