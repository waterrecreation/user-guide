# Earn Drips

## How to earn Drips on Popula?

The acquisition of drips primarily falls into two categories:

1. **Active Drips** \~ Drips that are **actively** earned by `post`, `comment`, `like`, `Poll/Proposal` and `referral`
2. **Passive Drips** \~ Drips that are **passively** delivered by being `commented`, `liked`, `voted` or `echoed`.

### **Active Drips**

| Activity      | Drips |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Post          | +1    |
| Comment       | +1    |
| Like          | +0.2  |
| Poll/Proposal | +1    |
| Referral\*    | +10   |

After successfully posting a Post, publishing a Comment, or Liking a post, you will receive a real-time pop-up alert on the top right corner of the page. :bellhop:

### **Passive Drips**

|             | Post | Comment | Sub-Comment |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| Comment     | 0.4  |         |             |
| Sub-Comment |      | 0.4     |             |
| Like        | 0.2  | 0.2     | 0.2         |

Passive Drips delivered to you through Echos are based on [Drip Royalties](drip-royalties.md).&#x20;

> üëâ For your poll/proposal, each vote you receive will deliver 0.2 Drips, for a detailed breakdown of Poll/Proposal, please see [How Drips work with Poll & Proposal?](how-drips-work-with-poll-and-proposal.md)

> \*Ô∏è‚É£ When you **refer** a community on Popula by sharing a post/comment to others who are not already on Popula, you will only be given the Drips for it on the condition that **the other person registers on Popula successfully via your referral link.**

The amount of Drips delivered to a post through likes and comments (passive drips) will be displayed at the bottom of the post, reflecting its popularity. The larger the amount, the more popular the post is.

### **Drip Bonus System**

To incentivise the first engagements, **the first one to comment under each post/comment** will be given a bonus of 2 Drips. For example, if you‚Äôre the first commentator under a post, you will get **2 drips** for **being the first one to comment.**

| Engagement    | Drips |
| ------------- | ----- |
| First Comment | +2    |
| The Rest      | +1    |

> üí° This also applies to **sub-comment** to a comment.

### **Drip Decay Mechanism**

To ensure the quality of community content and to protect the community from too much noise and spam, we have introduced the **Drip Decay Mechanism.** **Within a community**, the **first 10** posts/comments **in 24 hours** follows the above **Drip Earning Logic.**

| Activity     | The First 10 | After 10 |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Post/Comment | +1           | +0.4     |

> &#x20;üí° This Drip Decay Mechanism only affects your **active** Drip earning, and **will not affect your passive Drips received**.



‚ù£Ô∏è **Drip decay mechanism can also be stacked with the Drip Bonus System.**

For example, if you‚Äôre the first comment under a post, but you have already posted more than 10 posts in this community, you will attain **0.8 Drips** for this comment.

### Earn **Drips from Effective Report**

To help community moderators better maintain the community vibe and filter out content that does not follow the terms and conditions of the community, members in the community may report unhealthy and inappropriate content according to the rules.

When the report is **approved**, the reported content will be hidden from the community, and the reporter will be able to claim back the staked 1 Drip and be given **1 extra Drip**.

> ‚ùó **Note:** please make sure to report responsively, otherwise you will lose your staked 1 Drip.
