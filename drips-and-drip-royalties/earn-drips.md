# Earn Drips

#### How to earn Drips on Popula?

Drips can be attained from two aspects:

1. **Actively** earned by `post`, `comment`, `like`, `Poll/Proposal` and `referral`
2.  **Passively** delivered by being `commented`, `liked`, `voted` or `echoed`.

    _Passive drips are delivered to the original post/comment creator._ For example, **when your posts/comments receive comments, likes, or are echoed,** you will also get passive Drips for them.

*   **Active Drip Earning**

    | Activity      | Drips |
    | ------------- | ----- |
    | Post          | +1    |
    | Comment       | +1    |
    | Like          | +0.2  |
    | Poll/Proposal | +1    |
    | Referral\*    | +10   |
*   **Passive Drips Delivered to your Post/Comment**

    |             | Post | Comment | Sub-Comment |
    | ----------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
    | Comment     | 0.4  |         |             |
    | Sub-Comment |      | 0.4     |             |
    | Like        | 0.2  | 0.2     | 0.2         |

    Passive Drips delivered to you through your echoed content are based on [Drip Royalties](drip-royalties.md).

    &#x20;üëâ For your poll/proposal, each vote you receive will deliver 0.2 Drips, for a detailed breakdown of Poll/Proposal, please see [How Drips work with Poll & Proposal?](how-drips-work-with-poll-and-proposal.md)



    \*Ô∏è‚É£ When you **refer** a community on Popula by sharing a post/comment to others who are not already on Popula, you will only be given the Drips for it **if the other person opens the link and registers on Popula successfully.**



The number of drips delivered to a post through likes and comments (passive drips) will be displayed at the bottom of the post, reflecting its popularity. The larger the number, the more popular the post is.

Post Drip Stats

#### **Drip Bonus System**

To incentivise the first engagements, **the first one to comment under each post/comment** will be given a bonus of 2 Drips. For example, if you‚Äôre the first commentator under a post, you will get **2 drips** for **being the first one to comment.**

| Engagement    | Drips |
| ------------- | ----- |
| First Comment | +2    |
| The Rest      | +1    |

üí° This also applies to **sub-comment** to a comment.



#### **Drip Decay Mechanism**

To ensure the quality of community content and to protect the community from too much noise and spam, we have introduced the **Drip Decay Mechanism.** **Within a community**, the **first 10** posts/comments **in 24 hours** follows the above **Drip Earning Logic.**

| Activity     | The First 10 | After 10 |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Post/Comment | +1           | +0.4     |

&#x20;üí° This Drip Decay Mechanism only affects your **active** Drip earning, and **will not affect your passive Drips received**.



‚ù£Ô∏è **Drip decay mechanism can also be stacked with the Drip Bonus System.**

For example, if you‚Äôre the first comment under a post, but you have already posted more than 10 posts in this community, you will attain **0.8 Drips** for this comment.

#### Earn **Drips from effective Report**
