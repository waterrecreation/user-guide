# Earn Drips

## How to earn Drips on Popula?

The acquisition of drips primarily falls into two categories:

1. **Active Drips** \~ Drips that are **actively** earned by [post](../interactions-and-engagements/post.md), [reply](../interactions-and-engagements/comment.md), like, [Poll/Proposal](../interactions-and-engagements/poll-and-proposal.md), [reports](../interactions-and-engagements/report-and-delete.md#report) and [invites](../interactions-and-engagements/invite.md).
2. **Passive Drips** \~ Drips that are **passively** delivered by being replied to, liked, voted or echoed.

Earning Drips through fundamental interactions, such as posting or commenting, adheres to the rules of the [Drip Bonus and Drip Decay system](earn-drips/drip-bonus-and-decay-system.md).
