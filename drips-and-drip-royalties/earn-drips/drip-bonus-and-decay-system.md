# Drip Bonus & Decay System

## **Drip Bonus System**

To incentivise the first engagements, **the first one to comment under each post/comment** will be given a bonus of 2 Drips. For example, if you‚Äôre the first commentator under a post, you will get **2 drips** for **being the first one to comment.**

<table><thead><tr><th width="516">Engagement</th><th>Drips</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First Comment</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>The Rest</td><td>+1</td></tr></tbody></table>

> üí° This also applies to **sub-comment** to a comment.

## **Drip Decay Mechanism**

To ensure the quality of community content and to protect the community from too much noise and spam, we have introduced the **Drip Decay Mechanism.** **Within a community**, the **first 10** posts/comments **in 24 hours** follows the above **Drip Earning Logic.**

| Activity     | The First 10 | After 10 |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Post/Comment | +1           | +0.4     |

> &#x20;üí° This Drip Decay Mechanism only affects your **active** Drip earning, and **will not affect your passive Drips received**.



‚ù£Ô∏è **Drip decay mechanism can also be stacked with the Drip Bonus System.**

For example, if you‚Äôre the first comment under a post, but you have already posted more than 10 posts in this community, you will attain **0.8 Drips** for this comment.
