# Earn Drips from Effective Report

To help community moderators better maintain the community vibe and filter out content that does not follow the terms and conditions of the community, members in the community may report unhealthy and inappropriate content according to the rules.

When the report is **approved**, the reported content will be hidden from the community, and the reporter will be able to claim back the staked 1 Drip and be given **1 extra Drip**.

> ❗ **Note:** please make sure to report responsively, otherwise you will lose your staked 1 Drip.
