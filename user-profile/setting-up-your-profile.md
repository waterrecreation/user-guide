# Setting Up Your Profile

Next, it’s time to set up your profile!

Now that we’re already familiar with interfaces. You can either edit your profile page by clicking the edit button in the top right corner of your profile page, or you can do it in [**Settings**](../getting-started/interface.md#settings-section).

In **Profile Settings**, you have the option to change your [display name](../getting-started/profile-setup.md), introduce yourself, upload a profile image and banner, and link your Twitter and Discord accounts. Once linked, they will be displayed on your profile page.
