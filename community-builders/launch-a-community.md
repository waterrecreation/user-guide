# Launch a community

If you want to launch an on-chain community with your cabal and coterie then Popula is the place to go.

To get started, click on the invite link shared to you in the email.

To proceed with launching your community, you will need to log in using your NEAR wallet.

Alternatively, you can choose to log in via your **Metamask wallet.** Popula supports the creation of a **non-custodial** NEAR wallet through Metamask login, powered by Lit Protocol.

Ensure that your wallet has a minimum balance of **9.5 N** (NEAR tokens, $NEAR). This balance will cover the community deployment fee.

Once you’re ready, you can then proceed to launch your community. The platform will guide you through the process, allowing you to set up your on-chain community with ease.

First of all, you'll need to give your community a **Community Name**.

1. when entering the name you choose, the contract name displays simultaneously below.
2.  You can edit the name later in the **Community Console**, but **once the community is established, the community contract address will no longer be able to be altered, as shown below:**

Once you have decided on your Community Name, upload your Community Profile Image to visually draw your fellow bees in. Or you can skip this part and choose to upload an image later on in **Community Console**.



⭐ Keep in mind that on Popula, **each community has its own independent smart contract, where all content and interactions generated by that community are stored. The community’s smart contract is a permanent and transparent record of the community’s activity from the moment of creation.**&#x20;

Once you confirm the launch of the community, you will be required to approve a transaction to transfer 9.5 $NEAR on the NEAR Protocol. This fee is not paid to Popula, but is for covering the **deployment fee** of your independent community smart contract on the blockchain.
