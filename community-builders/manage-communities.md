# Manage communities

Once you have launched your community, you can manage it using **Community Console**.

**Community Console** can only be accessed by Community Originators and Community Moderators.

You can enter the Community Console under the Community Name on the community page.

There are three sections in the **Console**:

* General
* Participants
* Monitors

Each section contains multiple subsections. Please refer to the details below.

#### Community Section

In this section, you can change the **community profile image**, **community name** and **add a community bio**.

There are more features in the toggled **Advanced Settings** if you want to make your community more personalised, including

* **Community Information** - more detailed information about your community, max 500 characters.
* **Profile Banner** - decorate your community page with a larger image that stretches across the top of the community page, serving as an additional part for personalisation and branding
* **Twitter Verify** - verify the official Twitter account for your community, signaling the legitimacy and official association with the community it represents
* **Discord link** - attach an invite link to the community Discord server making it more convenient for community members to locate the platform for instant messaging
* **Website link** - add the official website link associated with your community, if applicable.
* **Customised application form -** place links to various ongoing application processes, including whitelist applications, membership requests, event registrations, or grant applications

**Rules:** Please then create the guidelines you wish your community to follow; to encourage a positive, friendly and safe environment. Feel free to refer to the **sample guidelines** \*\*we have given you to use.

[Sample Community Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Sample-Community-Guidelines-f3aa85968a22429882cdfd189faf6418?pvs=21)

**Accessibility:**

Using the **Accessibility section**, you can also determine

* different levels of access to posting/commenting, including open access for all members, limited access to whitelisted members, and exclusive access to community originators.
* if community members must hold a certain amount of Drips in order to post.
* if token-gating is allowed in the community: decide if you wish to turn on (by sliding the gray button to the right in the yellow box) or leave off posting token-gating contents

**Who can submit a proposal?**

Do you want everyone to be able to submit a proposal? (All Members), The Community Originator (yourself) or just Mod members only (moderator).

**Visitor account**

The visitor account balance is the gas fee and storage required when a visitor interacts in the community that needs to be covered if you choose to turn ‚Äúallow visitors to interact‚Äù on.

The balance will show as above, circled in red and the option to top this balance up or apply for grants is to the right of this.

Once enabled, you can further specify which specific action and the maximum daily limit for each action that a visitor is allowed to perform in your community.

#### Participants Section

This is split into three groups: all, grouped and banned so you can come back and refer to these lists at any time to check

**All:** you can see a list of all members in your community.

Move your mouse over a specific user and you will see the button to quickly add a role **Group** for it or ban this user. If a member breaks the community rules you also have the option to ban them for a chosen period of time. Admins can manage bans to avoid malicious content and misbehavior.

üö´ If a user is banned, they will **NOT** earn any Drips **ACTIVELY** from actions such as posting, liking, or commenting until their banning period has finished. However, this will not affect their [passive Drips earnings](https://www.notion.so/3dfc484da8624c3e912d39ab152b5934?pvs=21) delivered by previous posts.

Popula allows community admins to set up **Groups** within the community and give them different permissions. **This enables community management at a granular level.**

Entering **Groups**, you can see **Banned;** **the banned members and Mod; moderators.**

To create additional groups, click the **Create new group** button located in the top right corner of the page, name the group, pick a displayed color, and set the permission you wish to. Once it‚Äôs created, you‚Äôll be able to add and remove members at any time.

For example, If you want to set someone as the Community Admin, you can simply create a new group, and then enable **permission** for this role.

Next, add members to this group. Go to **Groups - Members** and add a new member with their wallet address.

Remember to **save changes** after making all adjustments.

As all membership data is, again, **stored on chain y**ou‚Äôll have to approve the transaction to save the changes.

#### Monitors Section

Here, you can see the posts that have been pinned as well as the ones that have been reported in the community.

**Pinned posts** - refer back to this list at any time to unpin a pinned post and ensure you save the changes. You can also change the order of the pinned post.

**Report** - refer to this list in order to see what has been reported

You will be able to **take action on the reported posts** here: choose how you wish to solve the reported action: to approve, disapprove, or ignore the reported action

Member report behavior: \[-1 Drips]

Each report requires depositing 1 Drip

* If you **approve** the report, the post will be hidden for all members except for the moderators and the poster themself. The reporter will get the 1 drip deposit back and will be rewarded with 1 drip for the successful report **\[+2 Drips]**
* If you **ignore** the report, e.g.: If there is no reason for reporting, or the reported content does not clearly violate the rules (only borderline), the reported content will remain visible and the 1 Drip deposited will be returned **\[+1 Drips].**
* If you **disapprove** the report, the reported content will also remain the same, but the reporter‚Äôs staked 1 Drip will be **slashed** as this is deemed as a spam report \[+0 Drips]

As for **pinning a post**, click the shield icon on the bottom right corner of a post on the community homepage and choose to pin the post.

The posts you have pinned will be displayed at the top of your community post feeds.

To manage pinned posts, you can go to **Community Console - Monitor, Pinned Post** to change their order or unpin them.
