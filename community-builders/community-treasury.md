# Community Treasury

A Community Treasury is a dedicated pool of funds that is collectively owned and managed by the community members. It holds various token assets that have been contributed to the organization.

The Community Treasury is closely integrated with the on-chain governance mechanism on Popula. The Community Treasury provides transparency and clarity on how the community's funds are allocated and utilized. By exploring the Treasury page, you can gain valuable insights into the financial operations of the community and stay updated on the funding activities within the Community.

To access the Community Treasury on Popula, you can simply navigate to the Community Overview, and scroll down to see the Treasury board. You can also click on "More" to access additional details about the Treasury's funds and activities.

## **Utilising Funds in Community Treasury**

The funds in the Community Treasury **can only be used through** [**proposals**](../interactions-and-engagements/poll-and-proposal.md) that have been approved to ensure responsible and transparent financial decision-making. The funds in the Community Treasury are safeguarded by the community contract. This implies that no individual has arbitrary authority to withdraw the funds from the Community Treasury, and all activities related to the Community Treasury are traceable and transparent.

If you have an idea or project that requires funding, you can submit a proposal asking for transferring a certain amount of tokens in the Treasury to a certain address. Clearly outline the purpose of the proposal, the amount of funds needed, and how the funds will be used to benefit the community.

If your proposal receives sufficient support and is approved by the community, the funds required in the proposal will be allocated from the Community Treasury.
