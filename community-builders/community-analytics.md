# Community analytics

Popula provides a variety of analytics and insights related to Members and Drips, allowing users and community leaders to track engagement, growth, and overall community well-being using on-chain data. This helps in taking more informed and efficient steps to manage the community.

#### **Community Ranking**

On the **Community** page, you will see a complete list of all the communities that have been created on Popula. The list is sorted by Popularity (Total Drips of Communities) by default, but you can also sort it by Engagement (Added Drips in 24h) or the Launch Date of the Communities.

#### **Community Overview**

Other than a broad view of all the communities on Popula, Go to the Community Overview page in a community to view its information and statistics.

There are 6 sections on the Community Overview page.

* Information
* Contract
* Treasury
* Rules
* Members
* Vibe Pulse

If you are the Community Originator or Admin, you’ll see the edit button beside each editable section.

*   **Member Ranking**

    Each community features a members leaderboard where you can see the top 10 users with the most Drips in this community, and where you rank on it.

    You can also click on "All" to see the full list of community members, along with their joined date and total Drips. It can also be sorted by various metrics.

    You can easily search for an address to see if the person has already joined the community.
*   **Vibe Pulse**

    It’s a **Community Drip Overview** which indicates the community Drip activities.

    These data-driven insights empower leaders to make more scientific decisions and design activities that yield the best results for their communities.
