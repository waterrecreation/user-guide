# Community analytics

Popula provides a variety of analytics and insights related to Members and Drips, allowing users and community leaders to track engagement, growth, and overall community well-being using on-chain data. This helps in taking more informed and efficient steps to manage the community.

### **Community Overview**

Other than a broad view of all the communities on Popula, Go to the Community Overview page in a community to view its information and statistics.

There are 6 sections on the Community Overview page.

* Information, including community contract address and related links.
* Community Treasury
* Community Rules, that is, Community Guidelines.
* Members Ranking
* Vibe Pulse

If you are the Community Originator or Admin, you’ll see the edit button beside each editable section.

### **Member Ranking**

Each community features a member leaderboard where you can see the member rankings based on different metrics, and where you rank on it.

The key metrics include:

* Total Drips generated
* Drip burned by others
* Join date

You can also filter the list by Groups.&#x20;

Additionally, you can easily search for an address to see if the person has already joined the community, and view his or her achievement based on the metrics.
