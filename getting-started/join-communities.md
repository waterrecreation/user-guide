# Join Communities

Community is where the magic happens. ðŸª„

Here, members can communicate, engage, and bond on a deeper level while maintaining control of their data, content, and social graphs. Meanwhile, the contributions of members are provable and everlasting.

Check out the steps below and let the magic begin! ðŸ”®

Whenever you see a community that resonates with your interests and values,  you can join the community.

At this point, you will come across the community rules, if they have been set by the community originator. This will provide you with a clearer understanding of the community you are joining, and will serve as a second confirmation that its values and atmosphere are truly a good fit for you and what you seek. Also, these are the rules for joining the community, you will have to agree and follow the rules within the community, otherwise, the community moderators have the right to ban you from the community for preaching the rules.

Once you click on the **Agree & Join** button, you will need to approve a transaction to become the member of this community.

&#x20;ðŸ’¡ The action of Joining a Community will be recorded as a transaction on NEAR Protocol. As a result, you will be required to pay a **0.05N** fee primarily to cover the [**storage staking**](https://docs.near.org/concepts/storage/storage-staking) on NEAR in advance. This fee is for your future engagements, so you wonâ€™t need to approve [transactions](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/transactions/gas) every time you engage.

Once finish the above steps, congrats! Welcome to the community! Your journey begins here. Share your story, content, and thoughts with the community in the dedicated feed.

Detailed information about each action you've had in communities can be viewed in the [**Transactions**](navigate-popula.md#profile-section) section which you can find on your profile page as described in [Interface](navigate-popula.md).
