## Profile Section

This section allows you to view your profile page, which shows your followers and followings, as well as all of your past interactions on Popula.

You will also see the date of following and TxIDs after each follower/following on both pages. Clicking on ‚ÄúTx‚Äù will take you to the specific transaction on [Nearblocks](https://nearblocks.io/) that records this action.

Every action you perform on Popula is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.
