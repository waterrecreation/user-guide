# Link Accounts

In **Settings - Email Settings**, you can verify your email address. This ensures that we are prepared to send push email notifications at a later time.

In **Settings - Linked Accounts**, you can connect to several accounts outside Popula with your Popula account. You can link to your Ethereum or X(prev. Twitter) accounts from here. By linking these accounts, you will be able to claim your [**Drip Royalties**](../drips-and-drip-royalties/drip-royalties.md) from [**echoed**](../interactions-and-engagements/echo.md) contents.

By the way, if you have **multiple Ethereum wallets or Twitter accounts**, linking to all of them is no problemo! ðŸ˜Ž
