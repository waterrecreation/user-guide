# Your username and display name

Your username, the same as your NEAR wallet ID, is unique to your account, and appears in your profile URL.

Your display name, referred to as name, is a personal identifier on Popula and is separate from your username. At your first login, Popula will use your username as your default name, however, you can change it whenever you want. It can be anything you want to name yourself, and is displayed on your profile page on top of your username.

Your name is visible when posting, commenting or making any interactions in the community. It is also your handle, whenever people mention you in a post or a comment, or when anyone echos your content, your name will be displayed.

You can change your name in the Settings section.
