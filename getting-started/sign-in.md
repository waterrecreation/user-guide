3. Upon signing in, enter a account address for your NEAR wallet that is going to be created. (There's a NEAR wallet created when logging in via Metamask wallet for the first time, and your EVM account is linked with the NEAR account created.)
4. Then you'll be able to enjoy a smooth gasless experience in Popula communities with [Visitor Mode](visitor-mode.md).&#x20;
5.  Be sure to export and keep your private key safe! You can always export your private keys or check your NEAR account here on your Profile Page.
