# Visitor Mode

### **Understanding Visitor Mode:**

Introducing the brand-new Visitor Mode, a solution designed to enhance your experience in Popula communities without the hindrance of gas fees. Visitor Mode is all about making your journey within the community smoother.

New to NEAR Blockchain and perplexed about acquiring $NEAR or comprehending gas fees? Fear not, as Popula Visitor Mode has got you covered. Once enabled by the community, users can actively engage without joining the community or the burden of gas fees.

Your gas fees are covered by the Popula Relayer via metatransactions. :raised\_hands:

### Using Visitor Mode:

1. Log in via Metamask
2. Go to the community you wish to engage
3. Agree to the community rules by clicking on the "Agree Rules".
4. Start to post, comment, like, or vote in the community. \
   Your will find a "Visitor" tag beside your name on your posts if you're under the Visitor Mode.

### **Restrictions of Visitor Mode**

For Visitors, it's essential to understand the specific limitations in place:

#### **Visitor Mode Activation**:

Visitor Mode is accessible only if the community has enabled this feature.

#### **Activity limits:**

Community originators have the flexibility to set activity limits for visitors. If your daily activities reach the limit, a nominal $NEAR top-up is required to [join the community](join-communities.md) and continue engaging.&#x20;

#### Gasless experience for engagements only:

While Visitor Mode offers a gasless experience for general engagements within the community, it's crucial to note that gas fees are still applicable when officially[ **joining the community**](join-communities.md) or [claiming Drips](../drips-and-drip-royalties/claim-drips.md).
