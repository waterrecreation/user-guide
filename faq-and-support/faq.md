# FAQ

### **What is Popula?**

Popula is a platform on NEAR Protocol offering on-chain tools for communities to record, own, verify, control and monetise their engagement data.

Anyone can easily launch a private or public community, each with its independent smart contract. All interactions (posts, likes, comments, share, follow, etc.) are recorded on-chain and generate Drips, non-transferable fungible tokens, which incentivize contribution and create a transparent and immutable record of each member’s contribution and reputation.

The platform also offers various features, including the ability to conduct decentralised community management and governance and facilitate community-driven initiatives.

Popula is part of the NEAR ecosystem and is dedicated to promoting community growth and engagement.



### **Why it matters to launch a community on Popula?**

One of the main benefits of this platform is that it allows community members to communicate within the community, and the Drip Protocol adapted by Popula will recognise community-driven activities. Signalling high-quality content and improving community interactions.

### **What are gas fees?**

### **Why do I need to pay $NEAR when launching a community?**

Each Popula community has its own smart contract, which is automatically deployed by the Popula Community Factory Protocol, another contract dedicated to creating community contracts for each new community. Please note that **deploying a contract on NEAR will incur fees, including gas and storage fees.** Therefore, when starting a community on Popula, you need to deposit **9.5 $NEAR** to cover the cost of deploying the contract.

For more details, please refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/transactions/gas-advanced#deploying-contracts).

### **What is Visitor Mode?**

The Visitor Mode is a feature that helps communities reduce the cost of onboarding single sign-in users through meta-transactions. Community moderators can enable the Visitor Mode in Community Console and top up the Visitor’s Account to cover gas fees for visitors. Community moderators can also choose which activities visitors can access in their Community.
