#### **Contributing to Community Treasury**

As Community members or admins, you can also donate funds to the Community Treasury.

#### **Utilising Funds in Community Treasury**

The funds in the Community Treasury **can only be used through** [**proposals**](../interactions-and-engagements/poll-and-proposal.md) that have been approved to ensure responsible and transparent financial decision-making. The funds in the Community Treasury are safeguarded by the community contract. This means that no single individual has the authority to withdraw the money on their own will, and all activities related to the Community Treasury are traceable and transparent.

If you have an idea or project that requires funding, you can submit a proposal asking for transferring a certain amount of tokens in the Treasury to a certain address. Clearly outline the purpose of the proposal, the amount of funds needed, and how the funds will be used to benefit the community.

If your proposal receives sufficient support and is approved by the community, the funds required in the proposal will be allocated from the Community Treasury.
